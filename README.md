Leixlip Dog Grooming – Responsive Website

A modern, mobile-first website built to showcase Leixlip Dog Grooming’s services and make appointment booking easy and intuitive. The site features responsive design, semantic HTML with ARIA for accessibility, and performance optimizations to support fast load times and strong SEO. Styled with clean CSS, the UI is both user-friendly and visually appealing across devices.

The project was later refactored in Next.js to improve maintainability and performance, including enhanced routing, image optimization, and SEO. This updated version is private and available upon request. The original version is open-source and licensed under MIT.
